# Placeholder for Georgia-ReBORN Theme "Skin"


I added "three" custom themes and "twelve" Reel to Reel Tapes and "twelve" Vinyl Placeholders.



## Recommendation:

> The Pink.Colors theme: The best matches with "RTM.LPR90.Pink" and "SONY.Pink.EMPTY" and "Vinyl.Rosé.1"

> Orange.Dream theme: The best matches with "Airbrush.R2R.Orange"

> Planet.Freddie theme: The best matches with "Airbrush.R2R.Freddy" and "Airbrush.R2R.Planet" and "Airbrush.R2R.Universe"



## how to use:

Download the zip folder, unpack it, and copy the "profiles" folder into your Foobar root directory. -> "where the Georgia-ReBORN theme is also located"

· you can set the custom placeholder via -> Details options menu -> Disc art placeholder -> and set what like :)

· you can manually edit "georgia-reborn-custom.jsonc" if you like.


## File location:

> "profile/georgia-reborn/configs/georgia-reborn-custom.jsonc"


"All vinyls and tape reels are my own property.
They were photographed and edited in Photoshop.
I've never used Photoshop before, so my placeholders are not perfect,
but i like it a bit. ;D
